# Recursive Reality Engine

## Overview

The Recursive Reality Engine is an experimental platform for creating self-modifying creative systems. It explores the boundaries between code, art, and emergent behavior through recursive computational processes.

## Core Concepts

### Self-Modification

At the heart of the engine lies the ability for programs to rewrite themselves during execution. This creates:

- **Evolutionary algorithms** that improve their own fitness functions
- **Generative systems** that modify their own generation rules
- **Adaptive interfaces** that reshape based on user interaction patterns

### Recursive Structures

The engine leverages multiple levels of recursion:

1. **Code recursion**: Functions that call modified versions of themselves
2. **Data recursion**: Structures that contain transformed copies of themselves
3. **Meta-recursion**: Systems that recursively modify their recursion patterns

## Technical Architecture

```typescript
interface RecursiveSystem {
  execute(): void;
  modify(rule: TransformationRule): RecursiveSystem;
  evaluate(): PerformanceMetrics;
  spawn(): RecursiveSystem[];
}
```

### Key Components

- **Transformation Engine**: Applies rule-based modifications to system components
- **Evaluation Framework**: Measures system performance and aesthetic qualities
- **Visualization Layer**: Renders recursive structures in real-time using WebGL
- **Sandbox Environment**: Safely executes self-modifying code using Web Workers

## Applications

### Generative Art

Create visual compositions that evolve based on:
- Viewer interaction
- Environmental data
- Internal feedback loops

### Music Synthesis

Generate musical patterns that:
- Learn from listener preferences
- Evolve harmonic structures
- Create self-referential compositions

### Code Poetry

Produce programs that:
- Generate meaningful text
- Modify their generation algorithms
- Create recursive narrative structures

## Future Directions

The project continues to explore:

- **Distributed recursion** across multiple computing nodes
- **Cross-domain synthesis** between different creative mediums
- **Emergent consciousness** in self-modifying systems

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/negentroper/recursive-reality-engine
cd recursive-reality-engine
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to experience the engine in action.
