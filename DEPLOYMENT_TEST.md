## Test Deployment: January 27, 2025

**Purpose**: Testing GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for automatic deployment

### Changes Made:
1. Updated landing page title to include version "v1.0"
2. Added deployment test documentation
3. Triggered CI/CD pipeline to validate:
   - TypeScript compilation
   - ESLint code quality checks
   - Docker image building
   - Deployment automation
   - Health check verification

### Expected Pipeline Behavior:
1. **CI Phase**:
   - âœ… TypeScript type checking
   - âœ… ESLint linting
   - âœ… Prettier formatting check
   - âœ… Security vulnerability scan
   - âœ… Next.js build verification

2. **CD Phase**:
   - âœ… Docker multi-stage build
   - âœ… Container security scan
   - âœ… Deployment to self-hosted server
   - âœ… Health endpoint verification
   - âœ… Post-deployment testing

### Test Results:
- **Commit Hash**: b9d082e (GitHub Actions workflow added)
- **Pipeline Status**: Will be monitored
- **Deployment Time**: Will be recorded
- **Health Check**: Will verify `/api/health` endpoint

### Notes:
This is a test deployment to validate the complete CI/CD workflow before production use.
